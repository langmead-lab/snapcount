Title: R/Bioconductor Package for interfacing with Snaptron for rapid querying of expression counts
Version: 0.99.0
Author: Rone Charles
Maintainer: Rone Charles <rcharle8@jh.edu>
Description: snapcount is a client interface to the Snaptron webservices
    which support querying by gene name or genomic region.
    Results include raw expression counts derived from alignment of RNA-seq samples
    and/or various summarized measures of expression across one or more regions/genes
    per-sample (e.g. percent spliced in).
