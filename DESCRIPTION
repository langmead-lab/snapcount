Title: R/Bioconductor Package for interfacing with Snaptron for rapid querying of expression counts
Version: 1.7.0
Authors@R:
    c(person(given = "Rone",
             family = "Charles",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: snapcount is a client interface to the Snaptron webservices
    which support querying by gene name or genomic region.
    Results include raw expression counts derived from alignment of RNA-seq samples
    and/or various summarized measures of expression across one or more regions/genes
    per-sample (e.g. percent spliced in).
